    <h2>What is 3D sculpting?</h2>

    <p>
        3D sculpting is the process with which is done with a specific software and 
        it involves the 3D artist in manipulating meshes <br> of objects similar 
        to what sculptors do. Using a material similar to clay, a digitized one, the 
        artists shape, stretch, and carve <br> the object using <em>digital tools</em>,
        resulting in a high-quality render of a Computer Graphics (CG) object.

    <h2>Digital Tools</h2>

    <p>
        3D softwares make use of digital tools such as brushes and tools that 
        <em>draw, smooth, snake hook</em>, and <em>grab</em>. These tools makes <br> 
        it easier for the artist to create certain details that uses real life 
        textures and objects as an example.

    <h2>Rendering a 3D sculpted model</h2>

    <p>
        A software which can do all that is mentioned above and outputs an 
        animation or image of the 3D model is the 3D software <br> known as 
        <strong><em>Blender</em></strong>. 
    </p>

    <p class="par2">
        Rendering refers to when a computer calculates the light within the 
        environment or scene that was created by the artist, in <br> order 
        to create the final image or animation. For the computer to calculate  
        the lighting, the render engine needs information <br> such as:
    </p>

    <ul class="par2">
        <li>Geometry</li>
        <li>Materials</li>
        <li>Light setup</li>
        <li>Textures</li>
        <li>World background</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="par2">
        However, these are only the basic information of what a render engine
        needs. In our case keyframes were also created in the <br> animation timeline,
        in which data of the 3D model from different camera views was stored, in 
        order to make the setup look <br> like it is turning upon a table once the 
        rendered animation is finalized.
    </p>

    <p class="par3">
        Blender has two built in render engines which include:
    </p>

    <ol class="par3">
        <li><strong>Eevee</strong> - a rasterized (fast) render engine</li>
        <li><strong>Cycles</strong> - a raytraced render engine which is
        much slower, however, it is more accurate and produces images 
        which are <br> based on how light bounces in real life.</li>
    </ol>
    

    <p class="par4">
        Below we can see some examples of rendered images from different camera
        views done through <em>Blender</em>.
