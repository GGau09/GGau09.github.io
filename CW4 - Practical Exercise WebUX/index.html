    <h2>What is 3D sculpting?</h2>

    <p>
        3D sculpting is the proces with which is done with a specific software, 
        that involves 3D artist manipulating polygon meshes <br> of objects similar 
        to actual sculptors. Using a material similar to clay (digitized), the 
        artists shape, stretch, and carve the object <br> using <em>digital tools</em>,
        resulting in a high-quality render of a Computer Grpahics (CG) object.

    <h2>Digital Tools</h2>

    <p>
        3D softwares make use of digital tools such as brushes and tools that 
        <em>draw, smooth, snake hook</em>, and <em>grab</em> which makes it easy 
        <br> for the artist to create certain details that imitate real life 
        textures and objects.

    <h2>Rendering a 3D sculpted model</h2>

    <p>
        A software which can do all that is mentioned above and outputs an 
        animation or image of the 3D model is the 3D software <br> known as 
        <strong><em>Blender</em></strong>. 
    </p>

    <p2>
        Rendering refers to when a computer calculates the light within the 
        environment or scene that was created, in order to create <br> the final
        image or animation. For the computer to calculate the lighting, the 
        render engine needs information from the scene, <br> such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Geometry</li>
                <li>Materials</li>
                <li>Light setup</li>
                <li>Textures</li>
                <li>World background</li>
            </ul>
        However, these are only the basic information of what a render engine
        needs. In our case keyframes were also created in the <br> animation timeline,
        in which data of the 3D model from different camera views was stored, in 
        order to make the setup look <br> like it is turning upon a table once the 
        rendered animation is finalized.
    </p2>

    <p3>
        Blender has two built in render engines which include:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Eevee</strong> - a rasterized (fast) render engine</li>
                <li><strong>Cycles</strong> - a raytraced render engine which is
                    much slower, however, it is more accurate and produces images 
                    which are <br> based on how light bounces in real life.
                </li>
            </ol>
    </p3>

    <p4>
        Below we can see some examples of rendered images from different camera
        views done through <em>Blender</em>.
