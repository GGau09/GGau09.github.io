                The term "cancel culture" has both uncertain origins and meaning (McGarvey Hidy, 2021). However, the Pew Research 
                Center had reported that the term's origin came from a 1980s song which used the word "cancel" as a term referring 
                to a break up with someone (McGarvey Hidy, 2021). With its repeated use in television and film, the term spread to 
                social media as well. It is the spurning of individuals and brands because of their comments, actions, or stances
                (Carlow University, 2022).
                <br><br>
                Cancel culture is presently commonly used in a pejorative sense within mainstream commentary. Media studies scholar
                Meredith Clark argued that cancelling and related practices such as "calling out" have been problematically "counter-
                framed through application of the reductive and malignant label of 'cancel culture'" (Ng, 2022). Furthermore, cancel 
                culture is used as a common way for people to speak against something they perceive as wrong. These public call-outs 
                typically start on digital media. 
                <br><br>
                People calling out perceived offences and injustices made by an individual or organisation is not new. Social 
                media is particularly damaging because of its broad reach and ability to diminish the human emotions of the one 
                being cancelled (Carlow University, 2022). Therefore, it leaves a digital trail of what could have been a momentary 
                slip and thus, leaving the individual or organisation vulnerable to any future insults (Carlow University, 2022).
                <br><br>
                Social media platforms are central spaces where relevant content is posted. It is also a space where public figures
                and fans interact with 'proof' of wrongdoing often drawn from public and private social media posts (Ng, 2022). One 
                specific example of popular media cancelling is the case of beauty vlogger James Charles in 2019, in which fans judge 
                other celebrities for their misbehaviour towards other people around them, generally also celebrities, in instances of
                interpersonal "drama" (Ng, 2022).
                Another kind of cancelling includes fan activism, such as the fan cancelling of the television series <i>The 100</i>
                in 2016 due to issues of LGBTQ representation and the 2014 #CancelColbert campaign spurred by a problematic tweet in
                its references to Asians (Ng, 2022).
                <br><br>
                The high-risk of cancel culture comes from it being anonymous, especially with our tendency to find more courage to say
                things through social media or other digital platforms that we would not say face to face to another individual (Carlow 
                University, 2022 & Dudenhoefer, 2020). According to psychology experts, this type of pack mentality, also known, as mob 
                mentality is the kind of "justice" which leaves people feeling ostracised and isolated from society. In fact, this brings 
                up the core element of cancel culture, public shaming, which has been used since socities were formed (Dudenhoefer, 2020). 
                Amanda Koontz builds on top of this and states that public shaming is public ritual that has been used for a long time which 
                helped uphold social bonds and make sure that people within a community were equal and understood the norms (Dudenhoefer, 2020).
