               The <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> describes cancel culture as the removal of support 
               for individuals and their work due to a diverse opinion or action committed that was 
               deemed as objectionable to the parties that are calling the out in public (Millet, 2023).
               Furthermore, social media is the platform used as a way to magnify public knowledge of the 
               perceived offence from which the cancel campaign spreads (Millet, 2023). 
               Philosopher, Norbert Bileny, points out that cancelling is a practice which is repeated and has 
               taken different forms throughout history (Millet, 2023). On the other hand, cancel culture supporters 
               argue that the practice is a means of empowering minorities, a way for people with less power than others
               to demand accountability when the system has failed to bring the offender to justice. In 
               addition, the practice of cancelling is also a means to bring about social change and exercise
               the legitimate right to criticise and ask questions (Millet, 2023).
               <br><br>
               For critics of cancel culture, asking questions runs the risk of turning into harassment. They 
               make the point that cancelling leads to bullying and can incite violence and threats worse than
               the original offence in question (Millet, 2023). Furthermore, it can also turn the internet into
               an uncontrolled courtroom rather than bringing social change (Millet, 2023).
               <br><br>
               In an editorial from an Australian newspaper known as <i>The Age</i> (2020) it was commented that
               many who take part in cancel culture, they believe that they have the right to determine what 
               limitations should be enforced on free speech. Whenever someone crosses the line, punishment
               would quickly follow. This, unfortunately, is mob justice with no official adjudicator (Bromell, 2022).
               <br><br>
               Among the generations of Silents and Boomers, liberals were slightly more likely than conservatives
               to support the free speech rights of someone with racist views, however, by the Millenial birth years
               support among liberals began to decline (Twenge, 2023). Therefore, supporting free speech, even for someone with racist
               views, is now more common among conservatives. Support for shutting down speech goes beyond racism
               and sexism to include political views and can go fully cancel culture to include people losing their
               jobs (Twenge, 2023). As politics become more deeply embedded with moral cultures and emotions, tolerance for opposing
               viewpoints fades, with Millenials and Generation Z at the forefront (Twenge, 2023).
               <br><br>
               Controversies around free speech have divided older generations from younger ones for decades,
               however, now the political and generational sides have been reversed (Twenge, 2023). In the past, 
               younger generations and liberals more often supported free speech rights, and older generations and 
               conservatives more often opposed them (Twenge, 2023).
